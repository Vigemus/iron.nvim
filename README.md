Interactive Repls Over Neovim

## What is iron.nvim

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/495376.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/495376)
Iron allows you to quickly interact with the repl without having to leave your work buffer

It both a plugin and a library, allowing for better user experience and extensibility at the same time.

## How to configure

Below is a very simple configuration for iron:

```lua
local iron = require("iron.core")

iron.setup {
  config = {
    -- If iron should expose `<plug>(...)` mappings for the plugins
    should_map_plug = false,
    -- Whether a repl should be discarded or not
    scratch_repl = true,
    -- Your repl definitions come here
    repl_definition = {
      sh = {
        command = {"zsh"}
      }
    }
    repl_open_cmd = require('iron.view').curry.bottom(40),
    -- how the REPL window will be opened, the default is opening
    -- a float window of height 40 at the bottom.
  },
  -- Iron doesn't set keymaps by default anymore. Set them here
  -- or use `should_map_plug = true` and map from you vim files
  keymaps = {
    send_motion = "<space>sc",
    visual_send = "<space>sc",
    send_line = "<space>sl",
    repeat_cmd = "<space>s.",
    cr = "<space>s<cr>",
    interrupt = "<space>s<space>",
    exit = "<space>sq",
    clear = "<space>cl",
  }
}
```
